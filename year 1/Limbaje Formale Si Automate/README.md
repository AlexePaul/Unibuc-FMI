### Project 1 is about DFA search
> - it uses a DFS algorithm to print all the words accepted by the DFA
### Project 2 is about finding all the words of length n that are generated by a given grammer
> - it uses the backtracking algorithm and checks at the end if it still has NON-terminating letters
