# Sprint Sesiune - Last DEV Sprint

## Sprint Dates:

- Start Date: 17.01.2024
- End Date: 24.01.2024

## Team Overview:

- Team Members: 
    - Alexe Paul
    - Liciu Stefan
    - Nitoi Antonio
    - Sandu Eduard

- Planned Capacity: All 4 members were active during this sprint

## Backlog Items planned to be developed and their completion status:

- Completing Direct Plan and final touches > 9/10
- Fixing bug on Gradual plan chart label computing > 10/10
- Implementing Dark Theme > 0/10 (we abandoned the idea eventually but taken into consideration for further versions)
- Implementing CI/CD Workflow using expo.dev/apple developer + Github Actions on main branch push > 9/10
- Added tests to be ran on CI > 7/10
- Merging all branches to the main branch for production > 10/10
- Fixing multiple bugs that appeared after merge > 10/10

Those which have an uncomplete status (Less than 10/10) were not achieved completely or deserved a finishing touch that will be added on future versions.

## Sprint Review 

- We finally merged everything together so we can rely more on compatibility issues between the parts we scheduled to work individually even though they were finished, we had to solve many bugs and conflicts 

- We managed to create a CI Pipeline that contains both tests and dependencies needed to be installed for tests to work 

- We didn't implement the Dark Theme during this sprint due to lack of time and we focused more on getting base functionalities to work perfectly

- There were bugs on merging the Direct + Gradual plan but were solved fast

## Sprint Retrospective

- It turned out that there was easier than expected to merge everything together and finally achieved a finished product that has
the User Interface prepared for any random user

- We could've implemented dark mode if we had more time probably but we encountered some compatibility issues with the way we started to implement it and had to abandon the idea for the moment

- The app looks a lot better with out new navigation sistem on bottom of the screen and is a lot more intuitive

- Overall design improved a lot more during this sprint
