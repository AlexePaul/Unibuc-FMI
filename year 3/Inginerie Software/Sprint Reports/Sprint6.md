## Backlog Items planned to be developed and their completion status:

- Created a design view for all the pages of the application that respects OS conventions using [Figma](figma.com) > 10/10 Designed but 5/10 implemented
- Changing page/screens logic to load components better > 8/10
- Implemented a Tab Navigation system that makes every page accesible from a Bar on the bottom of the screen > 10/10
- Implemented streak-based counter for the Direct plan, visual representation of the current streak and actions such as resetting the current/longest streak without smoking > 9/10
- Changed post-register form to let user choose between Direct and Gradual plan and loading necessary features which were already implemented for its' corresponding plan > 10/10

Those which have an uncomplete status (Less than 10/10 are prepared to be fulfilled by the next sprint)

## Sprint Review 

- We gave the application a little refresh regarding the visual aspect which is more conventional for both Android and IOS users.

- We are 100% familiar with the platforms we were using and we are now more volatile and capable to make changes/add features in a shorter amount of time.

- Direct plan and Gradual plan are now separated and the app takes now into consideration the post-registration form gathering input from the user in order to render the specific plan.

- We discussed more about the notification service which will be implemented further in time after we have proper working plans and data to be retrieved.

- We will take into consideration deploying a dark-theme for the application depending on the time available

## Sprint Retrospective

- We think the new design of the app is a massive upgrade to the user experience and will atract more users.

- We discussed about having a notification service that will cheer our users for the milestones they achieve or at least provide meaningful/motivational little messages throughout the day to improve the interaction with the smoke-quitting plans
