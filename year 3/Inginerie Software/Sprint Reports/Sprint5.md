## Sprint Review

- We finally managed to implement an app that can be used and have a minimal amount of bugs but there is a lot of improvement to do since there is not much customization for users. (So we can consider we achieved an MVP).

- This was a much more productive sprint than the previous ones since we learned more about the platforms we are using.

- We developed a logic to calculate the amount of cigarettes permitted per day based on users' habits which were not required after register since this sprint.

- Chart Visualization on dashboard was a must and we managed to implement it (looks better than we expected and works just fine).

- We took into consideration that we will move onto creating 2 types of possible plans to quit smoking - Direct and Gradual - which can be selected by the user in the post-register screen 

- We didn't involve any notification services yet but will probably take care of these into the next sprint

## Sprint Retrospective

- We are relieved that we made navigation between screens work fine after taking some time to figure it out.

- The Gradual plan is half-way done and the Direct plan is in progress but we still need to work on milestones that both the plans will share and will be shown for any user (such as money saved, improving lifespan chance, how many cigarettes you dodged, how many days have you been smoke-free etc.)

- Notification service is a must and we have to get going for it onto next sprints.
