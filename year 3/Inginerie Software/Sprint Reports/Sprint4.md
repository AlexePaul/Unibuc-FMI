Those which have an incomplete status (Less than 10/10 are prepared to be fulfilled by the next sprint)

## Sprint Review

- We took into consideration that we haven't been able to add social media login feature (UPDATE: will be pushed to further sprints if not eliminated)

- Login/Register with email and password work properly but we need to pass the login tokens across components

- We realised we are still far from an MVP since we implemented only base functionalities yet

## Sprint Retrospective

- We took some time to understand the platform we are using and get used to it but it should be easier as we move on

- Login system works well and it is fast. There are no critical bugs/errors that need to be solved by now, we just have to continue implementing the features discussed on the roadmap

- Into the next sprint we can focus more on functionalities that strictly face user experience across the quit-smoking journey
